> This is my fourth project in The Odin Project's Foundations Course. This simple web application generates a canvas with a dynamic size based on user input. Hovering over the canvas colors the pixels randomly using a rainbow palette. Each interaction with the same pixel increases its opacity by 10% until it reaches 100%.
